# Personalization

This section is clearly just a suggestion, you should find which theme fits you better, but as an one-fits-all approach i recommend `Agnoster` based themes. Initially as a Z shell theme, there's a clone for most shells out there, the Agnoster offers you:

- Current working directory
- Colorful command prompt with optional timestamp
- Git status, with current branch indicator and whether there's any changes
- Python virtual environment integration
- Last command failed indicator
- Background jobs indicator


To install it you need a powerline patched font, which, on Ubuntu, is as easy as 
```sh
sudo apt install fonts-powerline 
```
