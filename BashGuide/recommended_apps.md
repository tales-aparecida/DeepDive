## Bat
_A `cat` clone with wings_
If you've ever felt the need to quickly read some code but end up opening your favorite editor just to have some color, you will enjoy `bat`. It works just like `cat`, which reads files sequentialy, writing them to standard output, but with the great advantage of syntax highlight and git integration.

Follow the readme at `https://github.com/sharkdp/bat#installation` to install it.
