# DeepDive
Repo to store my researchs, trying to force myself to learn deeply some of my daily tools and, maybe, helping anybody who lands here.

## Projects
The main purpose was to learn data analysis, including ethical data mining, visualization and some machine learning topics, but then I thought about using the repo to store some Bash, Git and React Native knowledge too, just because I've been dealing with both a lot recently.
